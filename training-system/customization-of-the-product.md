# üñåÔ∏è Customization of the product

Our Training System provides you with the ability to customize the system to make it more useful for you & your training center!

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/New Project (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Workspace:**\
These can be customized in Workspace. It is recommended to do this when setting up our Training System.

## 1. Doors

In 'Workspace' you will see a folder named 'Doors'. These will automatically become invisible when the game starts, and you can only see them in studio.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Default Doors folder in Workspace</p></figcaption></figure>

These are the doors the training system interacts with, they have two categories:

### 1.1 CommandDoors

These doors are seen as a green forcefield in Roblox Studio and can be toggled by the !open and !close commands.&#x20;

For example, !open DoorA will allow anybody to walk through DoorA.&#x20;

#### Creating new command doors

To create a new command door, you can duplicate the current door ('DoorA') or create a new part and place it in that folder.\
Doors can be resized, moved or rotated. You can also change the properties.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All Command Doors **must** have a unique name. This is the name used by the command. Try keep these names simple for trainers to use and remember.
{% endhint %}

### 1.2 RankDoors

These are doors seen as a red forcefield in Roblox Studio by default. \
People above the Trainer Rank will be able to walk through these doors, anybody else will not.

#### Creating new Rank Doors

To create a new rank door, you can duplicate the current door ('RankA') or create a new part and place it in that folder.&#x20;

Doors can be resized, moved or rotated. You can also change the properties.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please make sure 'Anchored' is set as true for both Command & RankDoors.&#x20;

If 'Anchored' is false, the door will fall through the map and can not be closed.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Teleports

These are the locations a player is able to teleport to through the !teleport command or teleport trainees button.\
They are shown as 1x1x1 yellow forcefield cubes in Roblox Studio. Like Doors, they are made invisible when the game starts.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Picture of the default Teleports in Workspace</p></figcaption></figure>

There is two types of teleport location:

### 2.2 Group Teleports

These are the locations that the trainees teleport to when 'Teleport Trainees' is pressed. \
It must be named the letter of the group. For example, The destination where trainees in group B will teleport to should be named 'B'

All 4 of these teleporters come with the training system by default, you just need to move this to where you want them to teleport to.

### 2.2. Custom Teleports

These are teleport locations only available by using the !teleport command.\
For example, !teleport Jay CustomTeleportLocation will teleport Jay to the position of the CustomTeleportLocation part

#### Creating new Teleports

You can duplicate any teleport location and rename it. You could also create a new part and insert it under the teleports folder. It is recommended to have the size as 1x1x1 so you can accurately locate where the player will teleport to. (The center of the part)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Anchored must be set as true, if it is false the teleport locations may fall through the map and get destroyed.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Cameras

There is two cameras you can customize within the Training System. \
The parts will be hidden in game. &#x20;

A CameraPart in Roblox Studio will look like this:

The two surfaces show you the direction the camera will be looking at.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt="A picture of the Camera Part for the Stage Camera" width="523"><figcaption><p>A picture of a CameraPart</p></figcaption></figure>

Stud: This is seen at the top of the part. \
This shows you where the top of the camera will be.

{% hint style="success" %}
To avoid the camera being sideways or upsidedown. It is recommended to keep this pointing up. (Can be tilted to tilt the camera, as showin in the picture)
{% endhint %}

The hinge is pointing in the direction the camera will be looking at.&#x20;

The CameraPart above will show this:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>A picture of what the Camera will show</p></figcaption></figure>

### 3.1 StageCamera

This is the camera that will be shown to trainees when 'Stage Camera' is toggled.

This is a single part under Workspace

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can move or rotate this to change the stage camera

### 3.2. Information Camera

This is the camera animation that plays while the information is active

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Camera Animation Structure</p></figcaption></figure>

It has seperate folders, each with multiple camera parts.&#x20;

The code will go through each folder individually, and then tween between the cameras in the number order given  (1,2,3,4,5)\
It will teleport to Camera 1, but then move to 2, 3, 4...

{% hint style="info" %}
After finished customizing the cameras, you can move them to ReplicatedStorage so they are out of your way when developing. Make sure to update your settings though!
{% endhint %}



## 4. Settings

The training system has settings which can be changed to customize the Training System
